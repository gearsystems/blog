GEAR is an acronym for Government Enhanced Administrative Resource. GearSystems realise the GEAR through various procedures. GearSystems aim for a better society and are highly democratic.

>A better house makes an example for making a better street. A better street shall make an example for a better town. A better town shall set an example for a better city. A better city shall putforth a better state. When states become better, a nation shall prosper. GearSystems aim at impacting a town to a nation. GearSystem shall inculcate civic sense in the citizens of the nation in an innovative way.

A wrecked car can be fixed in an efficient manner, if one tries to fix petty issues first and move on to repairing the engine or fixing the gear box. And one can fix it fast enough, if the small problems(example:replacing with spare parts) are done with least pain(by procuring the parts apriori).

Similarly, we can consider a nation to be wrecked car. Consider, major problems as damaged engine or broken gears and minor problems as dent to the body, broken headlights, dead battery or damaged self motor. It might take long time if one starts solely working on fixing the engine or gears. Analogous to this,with a combined and organised effort, it takes a group of people to fix small problems in least amount of time and then focus their time on solving bigger problems like improving standards of life of every citizen, maintaining good GDP, less crime rates, eradicating child labour, good health, improved life expectancy etc.

GearSystems shall provide solutions to fix the nations petty issues(which can sometimes be major as we scale up). A broken road, broken street lights, broken/bad sign boards, broken water supply pipes, unattended garbage...these are all the problems which we can consider small to scale but large to make an impact or show effect on a certain locality. We often find these problems take too long a time get fixed, the reason might be unorganised or outdated time taking procedures or lazy officials to look at the issue. 

What if you can fix these problems as easily as you take a daily walk or a ride. What if you can report a problem without wasting precious hours of your life. What if you can fix your street roads with your mobile phone or a laptop.What if you can report a problem once and forget it since the public or community shall keep the driving force on the government organisations to clear it.

GearSystems shall do this for you. We build applications that pass the above hurdles for you. You find a problem, take your phone/camera out and click a picture of it. Tag the location and few words about the problem would really be great. We shall redirect your problem to the concerned authorities/organisations and make sure that the problems/issued are answered and solved as fast as possible.

Furthermore about GearSystems, it took its shape and form in the hostels and cafes of NIT Warangal and formulated, designed and implemented by a team of passionate developers. [GearSystems](http://github.com/gearsystems) are maintained opensource and anyone can contribute to make it best. EPICS which stands for Engineering Projects In Community Service stands as a driving force for the team to work and make this project a reality.

GEARs just started to spin up. Stay tuned for updates and awesome work we do. This blog shall consist of innovations, discoveries and fun developing the GEAR platform.
