August 30 2015 is a day of importance to GEAR Systems team since GEAR was pitched for the first time at [August Fest, Hyderabad](http://theaugustfest.com/) by [Sudheesh](http://sudheesh.gearsystems.org) and [Kranthi](http://kranthi.gearsystems.org).

As Founder of GEAR Systems [Sudheesh](http://sudheesh.gearsystems.org) says, "Dont worry about failure. You only need to be right once!", it turned out to be a great pitch for us at August fest with a whopping audience of 1000+ at [JRC Conventions and trade fairs](https://goo.gl/maps/1a4Ow). We presented our artillery involved at work and innovations we did, to achieve the sheer brilliance of GEAR, to the attendees of August Fest. We particularly received great feedback and accolades from Jayesh Ranjan, IAS , IT Secretary for Telangana State and he was inclined to our idea. We are really excited to work along with TS government and various other investors to scale up our system and bring it to v1.0 from beta stage.

We were the last of early startups to pitch from all the 30+ startups that attended August Fest and we nailed it. Over 48 hours, we have exchanged a lot of our ideations and proceedings with over 200 attendees. We had ample time to engage with various set of people ranging from fellow entrepreneurs to angel investors and government officials. People poured in feedback based on their experiences in startup industry and we gladly took note of it. These set of feedback are key to proper understanding of user base and more challenges to come for GEAR.

There were two questions raised by audience which followed as describing the B-Plan for GEARS and the hierarchy generation tools at use in GEARS. B-Plan for GEARS is a simple idea inspired from Facebook at work. We are thinking of launching GEAR for work or a subscription for premium set of organisations where in features are extended on request. Later question involved identifying hierarchy in a given organisation and automation of the processing of assigning complaints to the lowest order personal in the organisation. The problem shall escalate, depending on a fixed period of time and shall reach to the root of an organisation eventually over delayed polling for a problem. We use graph database(neo4j) for maintaining the hierarchy of organisation.

Our startup pitch concluded August Fest and we are really happy to be able to showcase our work to great minds. GEAR Systems is now jacked up and started shifting gears and throttling to reach out to citizens. Listen, we shall reach you soon.

PS: We appreciate [Team Illuminati](http://gearsystems.org/contributors/) for showering us with their contribution for Automated Complaint Registration Problem statement which they solved overnight in Hackathon 4.0 conducted by [Lakshya Foundation](http://www.thelakshyafoundation.org/). We also thank the army of two men,[Naveen Indala](https://www.facebook.com/nvn.gandhianengg) and [Anand Rajagopalan](https://www.facebook.com/anand.rajagopalan.547) from Lakshya Foundation for helping out GEAR Systems to reach out to our user base by sponsoring the Founder and Co-Founder to pitch at August Fest 2015.
